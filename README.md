The following project will be a sobering compilation of recipes that can be humorous.
This will attempt to make the website dynamic but professionally detailed and composed.
I hope you enjoy the compilaiton of recent culinary issues and 'adaptations' of classics.
In the near future I hope to leave a more interactive space available on the site.
Stay tuned as I develop a more conclusive web app blog space.
