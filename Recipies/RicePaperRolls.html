    <h2>Here's a recipe that went wrong when televised.</h2>
    <p>
        Take note how the method displays (follow packet instructions), as if indicating she wasn't humble to buy or use the correct ingredients. <br>
        Uncle Roger has his own take on this recipe, which will be displayed below in the near future. <br>
        The following is the recipe:
<h3>Ingredients <br>
Makes: 48 rolls <br>
Metric Cups
</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>100 grams rice vermicelli</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari if you need this to be gluten-free</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon thai fish sauce (nam pla) or vegan "fish" sauce if you need this to be vegetarian/vegan</li>
            <li>1 bunch fresh mint (roughly chopped)</li>
            <li>1 bunch thai basil (roughly chopped)</li>
            <li>Â½ cucumber (cut into thin batons)</li>
            <li>6 spring onions (finely sliced)</li>
            <li>12 rice paper spring roll wrappers</li>
            <li>soy sauce for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak the vermicelli according to the instructions on the packet, and drain once the translucent threads are rehydrated.</li>
            <li>Flavour the vermicelli with the rice vinegar, soy and fish sauces</li>
            <li>Add the chopped herbs, cucumber and spring onions, mixxing gently with your hands.</li>
            <li>Soak the rice pancakes (again, according to packet instructions) in a shallow bowl of hot water and then lay each one on a tea towel to pat dry.</li>
            <li>Run a fairly narrow strip of noodle mixture down the middle of the pancake, fold over one half and then carefully roll it up as tightly as you can.</li>
            <li>Slice each roll into four and then arrange them on a plate.</li>
            <li>If you want, pour some soy sauce into a few little bowls for dipping the rolls into as you eat.</li>
        </ol>
